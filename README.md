# Elixeum JS SDK

Welcome to the official JavaScript SDK for the Elixeum Platform! Our SDK provides a comprehensive suite of tools, resources, and documentation to facilitate seamless integration with Elixeum using **JavaScript**.

> [!WARNING]
> The SDK is Work-In-Progress and unstable.

## Features

- Easy-to-use API for interacting with the Elixeum Platform
- Supports both browser and Node.js environments

## Dependencies

For development following libraries are used:
- Node.JS (v20 and higher tested)
- Rollup with ESLint and Terser plugins

For use on website, just include the minified bundle and you are good to go.
No external libraries are required. The library is aiming ES5 compatibility for wider use in older browsers.

## Getting Started

We've included detailed installation and usage instructions in the following sections to help you get started with the **Elixeum JS SDK.** If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us through the [Issues](https://github.com/elixeum/elixeum-js-sdk/issues) section of this repository.
